# Games & AI Experiments

This repository contains a collection of game development and game AI
projects built primarily in Python.

The focus is not just on gameplay mechanics, but on:

-   Reinforcement Learning\
-   Game AI\
-   Procedural Generation\
-   ML-based strategy modeling\
-   Simulation & experimentation environments

Many projects here serve as research playgrounds for applying Machine
Learning and Data Science to interactive systems.
